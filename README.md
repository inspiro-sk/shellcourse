### What is shell script?

A shell script is basically a plain text file that contains a series of commands.
It produces the same result as if you would be executing the commands using command line.

Shell script executes top to bottom and line after line (side note: it is important to put function definitions before function call).

-   automate frequent tasks
-   execute task that is repetitive, but not done too often
-   to reduce chance of errors
-   to be used by others but performed to your standards
